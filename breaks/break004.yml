# Hints:
#  Can you ping/SSH to the new instance?
#  Does our OpenStack host VM have property connectivity? 
#  Where can we configure network access to/from instances?
#  What security group does this VM belong to? 
#  What rules are present for this security group?

        A user has spun up a new VM (vm1) and is unable to ping

        and SSH to the instance.

# !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
# !!! SPOILER ALERT !!!
# !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
#  
# Solution: 
# The default security group rules haven't been created. Fix like so: 
# nova secgroup-add-rule default icmp -1 -1 0.0.0.0/0
# nova secgroup-add-rule default tcp 22 22 0.0.0.0/0
