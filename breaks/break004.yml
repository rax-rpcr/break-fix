        The default security group rules haven't been created. Fix by running: 
        $ nova secgroup-add-rule default icmp -1 -1 0.0.0.0/0
        $ nova secgroup-add-rule default tcp 22 22 0.0.0.0/0

      msg: >
        Breakfix operation complete! To access the BF1 VM: 'ssh -p 2222 root@127.0.0.1' (password: rpcr). Task file is in /root/BREAKFIX.txt, hint files are in /root/HINT.txt, answer file is in /root/SOLUTION.txt. Good luck!<3

# Solution: 
# The default security group rules haven't been created. Fix like so: 
# nova secgroup-add-rule default icmp -1 -1 0.0.0.0/0
# nova secgroup-add-rule default tcp 22 22 0.0.0.0/0
